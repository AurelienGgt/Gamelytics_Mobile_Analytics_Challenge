## **Description**

Welcome to the **Gamelytics: Mobile Analytics Challenge**, a real-world-inspired dataset designed for data enthusiasts eager to dive deep into mobile game analytics. This dataset challenges you to analyze player behavior, evaluate A/B test results, and develop metrics for assessing game event performance.

## **Project Context & Tasks**

### **Task 1: Retention Analysis**

- **Objective:** Calculate the daily retention rate of players, starting from their registration date.
- **Data Sources:**
  - `reg_data.csv`: Contains user registration timestamps (`reg_ts`) and unique user IDs (`uid`).
  - `auth_data.csv`: Contains user login timestamps (`auth_ts`) and unique user IDs (`uid`).
- **Challenge:** Develop a Python function to calculate retention, allowing you to test its performance on both the complete dataset and smaller samples.

### **Task 2: A/B Testing for Promotional Offers**

- **Objective:** Identify the best-performing promotional offer set by comparing key revenue metrics.
- **Context:**
  - The test group has a **5% higher ARPU** than the control group.
  - In the control group, **1928 users** out of **202,103** are paying customers.
  - In the test group, **1805 users** out of **202,667** are paying customers.
- **Data Sources:**
  - `ab_test.csv`: Includes `user_id`, `revenue`, and `testgroup` columns.
- **Challenge:** Decide which offer set performs best, and determine the appropriate metrics for a robust evaluation.

### **Task 3: Event Performance Evaluation in "Plants & Gardens"**

- **Objective:** Develop metrics to assess the success of a time-limited in-game event where players can earn unique rewards.
- **Context:**
  - Players complete levels to win exclusive items, bonuses, or coins.
  - In a variation, players may be penalized (sent back levels) after failed attempts.
- **Challenge:** Define how metrics should change under the penalty variation and identify KPIs for evaluating event success.
